This software enables a 6-wheels rover (like the Discovery on Mars) to avoid skidding on any terrain. 
It has been built using JaDE, the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (see: http://jade.tilab.com/)

To read more about the project, you will find the documentation in the file: \JaDE software\doc\Project Report.html (or at http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Courses/SdLm1213Projects-SkiddingController)

To launch the project simply double click on \JaDE software\Launch project.bat
